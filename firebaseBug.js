The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email address is not properly formatted or if there is a network connectivity issue during the sign-in process.  This can lead to silent failures where the application doesn't provide clear feedback to the user about what went wrong.  Additionally, handling errors gracefully and presenting user-friendly messages can be challenging.
