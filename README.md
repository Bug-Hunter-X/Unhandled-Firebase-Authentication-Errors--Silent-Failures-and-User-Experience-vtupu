# Unhandled Firebase Authentication Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the Firebase Authentication SDK: silent failures during user sign-in.  The code showcases scenarios where invalid email formats or network problems lead to unexpected behavior, and the solution provides robust error handling and user-friendly feedback mechanisms.

## Problem
The Firebase Authentication SDK might not always provide clear error messages when sign-in fails due to invalid inputs or network connectivity issues. This can lead to a frustrating user experience with no indication of what went wrong. 

## Solution
The solution focuses on comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks and providing specific messages to the user based on the type of error.  This ensures that users receive informative feedback and understand why sign-in failed.
